  <h3>1. Agile Software Development </h3> <hr>
	-	SDLC disadvantage <hr>
	-	Agile advantage <hr>
 </div>
 
<div id="S2" class="tabcontent"> 
	<h3>2. Manifesto for Agile Development </h3> <hr> 
	<b>What is agile? Any methodology that subscribes to the Agile Manifesto </b><hr>
	-	Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools <hr>
	-	Working software over comprehensive documentation <hr>
	-	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation <hr>
	-	Responding to change over following a plan <hr>
	<b>XP Programming vs SCRUM </b><hr>
	i.	Scrum, XP period <hr>
	ii.	Changes handling between Scrum and XP <hr>
	iii.	Working Order <hr>
	iv.	Scrum doesn’t prescribe any engineering practices, XP does <hr> </h4>
	
	<b><u> Know the differences between different Agile methodologies such as between Scrum and Extreme Programming </b></u>

<div id="S3" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>3. Agile 12 Principles</h3> <hr>
	i.	Early and continuous delivery of valuable software <hr>
	ii.	Welcome changing requirements <hr>
	iii.	Deliver working software frequently with a preference to the shorter timescale <hr>
	iv.	Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project <hr>
	v.	Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done <hr>
	vi.	The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation <hr>
	vii.	Working software is the primary measure of progress <hr>
	viii.	The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely <hr>
	ix.	Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility <hr>
	x.	Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential <hr>
	xi.	The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams <hr>
	xii.	At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, the tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly <hr>
	<b><u>Understand the 12 principles of “agile” so that you can apply some principles to analyse a case and make recommendations</b></u>

<div id="S4" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>4. Agile Processes Scrum</h3>
	Scrum is an agile, lightweight process for managing and controlling software and product development in rapidly changing environments  <hr>
	-	Iterative, incremental process  <hr>
	-	Team-based approach  <hr>
	-	Developing systems / products with rapidly changing requirements  <hr>
	-	Controls the chaos of conflicting interest and needs  <hr>
	-	Improve communication and maximize cooperation  <hr>
	-	Protecting the team form disruptions and impediments  <hr>
	-	A way to maximize productivity  <hr>
	 
	** Sprint planning meeting – attended by product owner, scrum master and the entire Scrum team // high priority features, User Stories // Select Product Backlog completed within the Sprint  <hr>
	** Daily Scrum // 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development team // plan for next 24 hours task   <hr>
	Product Backlog vs Sprint Backlog  <hr>
	** Product Backlog in Scrum is prioritized features list  <hr>
	** Sprint Backlog is a list of tasks identified by the Scrum team to be completed within each Scrum sprint  <hr>

	Burn Down Chart: is a graphical representation of work left to do  <hr>
	** The outstanding work (or backlog) is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal.  <hr>

  <h3>5. Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) vs Test Driven Development (TDD)</h3>
	What is TDD? What is BDD? <hr>
	User Stories <hr>
	-	Enhancing customer value <hr>
	-	Fosters Collaboration and Improve Understanding <hr>
	-	Brings User Closer <hr>
	-	Building Blocks of the Product <hr>
	-	Boost Transparency <hr>
	Gherkin Language is a simple language for describing user stories (features) and test scenarios. The Given-When-Then encourages a structured approach to writing feature scenarios that all three parties including product owners, users and tester can understand each other <hr>
	Given…When...Then...And… <hr>

	<b><u>Be able to explain Gherkin language and give examples </u></b> <hr>

<div id="S6" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>6. Overview of Version Control System</h3>
	Centralized Version Control System <hr>
	Advantages <hr>
	-	Everyone knows to a certain degree what everyone else on the project is doing <hr>
	-	Administrators have fine-grained control over who can do what, and it’s far easier to administer a CVCS than it is to deal with local databases on every client <hr>
	Disadvantages <hr>
	-	Single point of failure (If the hard disk the central database is on becomes corrupted, and proper backups haven’t kept, there is a risk of losing everything.) <hr>

	Distributed Version Control System <hr>

	<b><u>Be able to explain LCVS, DCVS, CCVS and know the differences between them and be able to illustrate the concepts with diagram. </b></u><hr>
	<b><u>Know the differences between SCRUM and Extreme Programming </b></u><hr>
