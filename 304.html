  <h3>Lab 1</h3> <hr>
	<b>Q1. What’s e-commerce? </b><hr>
	
	E-commerce, in the popular sense, can be defined as: <u>the use of the Internet 
	and the Web to conduct business transactions. </u><hr>

	A more technical definition would be: e-commerce involves <b><u>digitally enabled commercial transactions between and among organizations and individuals </b></u><hr>
	
	<b>How does e-commerce differ from e-business?</b><hr>
	E-commerce differs from e-business in that <u>no commercial transaction, 
	an exchange of value across organizational or individual boundaries; 
	takes place in e-business. </u><hr>

	E-business is the digital <b><u>enablement of transactions and processes within </b>a firm and therefore does not include any exchange in value. </u> <hr>

	<b>Where does it intersect with e-business?</b> <hr>
	E-commerce and e-business intersect at the business firm boundary at the point where internal business systems link up with suppliers. For instance, e-business turns into e-commerce when an exchange of value occurs across firm boundaries.<hr>

	<b>Q2. What is information asymmetry? </b><hr>
	Information asymmetry refers to any <b>disparity in relevant market information among the parties involved in a transaction.</b><hr>

	It <b>generally</b> applies to information about price, cost, and hidden fees.<hr>
	
	<b>Q3. What is a marketspace?</b> <hr>
	A marketspace is <b>a location that is extended beyond traditional boundaries</b> because it is removed from the restrictions of geography and time. <hr>

	The ubiquity of e-commerce technologies liberates the market from these limitations. <hr>

	<b>Q4. What are benefits of costs and prices of universal standards? </b><hr>
	The three benefits are: <hr>

	Reduced <b>search costs</b> for consumers <hr>

	Becomes simpler, faster, with more <b>accurate price discovery</b> <hr>

	Lower market <b>entry costs</b> for merchants <hr>

	<b>Q5. Compare online and traditional transactions in terms of richness.</b><hr>

	Traditional transactions can provide <b><u>more richness in terms of face-to-face service including visual and aural cues.</b></u><hr>

	However, traditional transactions are <u>limited in terms of <b>how many people can be reached at a single time.</b></u><hr>

	Online transactions, which can be <u>global in reach</u>, can provide content that is <u>both complex and rich, overcoming the traditional trade-off between reach and richness.</u><hr>

	<b>Q6. Name three of the business consequences that can result from growth in information density.</b><hr>
	Growth in information density could result in: <hr>

	<b><u>Greater price transparency:</b></u> Consumers can easily find out the variety of prices in a market.<hr>

	<b><u>Greater cost transparency:</b></u> Consumers can discover the actual costs merchants pay for products.<hr>

	<b><u>Greater opportunities for marketers to practice price discrimination:</b></u> since marketers are able to gather much more information about their customers, they can segment the market into groups based on willingness to pay different prices for the same or nearly the same goods.<hr>

	<b>Q7. What is Web 2.0? Give examples of Web 2.0 sites and explain why you included item in your list.</b> <hr>

	Web 2.0 is a set of applications and technologies that allows users to <b>create, edit, and distribute content </b>; share preferences, bookmarks, and online personas; participate in virtual lives; and build online communities. <hr>

	In other words, Web 2.0 is the set of new, advanced applications that have evolved along with the Web’s ability to support <b>larger audiences and more involved content.</b><hr>

	Examples are: Facebook, YouTube, Photobucket, Google, Wikipedia and WordPress, among others, etc.<hr>

	<b>Q8. Give examples of B2C, B2B and C2C besides those listed in the chapter materials.</b><hr>
	<I><u>B2C: Electronic retailer: </u></I><hr>

	Netflix, McDonald’s, Coca Cola,	Nike<hr>

	<I><u>B2C: Service Providers: </u></I><hr>

	Expedia, Travelocity<hr>
	
	<I><u>B2C: Portals:</u></I><hr>

	Yahoo, WSJonline.com<hr>

	<I><u>B2B:</u></I><hr>
	LinkedIn, WeWork (was founded in 2010 with a mission to build shared office spaces and build community.)<hr>

	<I><u>C2C:</u></I><hr>
	Amazon, eBay<hr>
	
	
	<b>Q9. How are the Internet and the Web similar to or different from other technologies that have changed commerce in the past?</b><hr>

	The Internet and the Web are similar to other technologies that have changed commerce in the past in that <b>each new technological innovation spawns explosive growth characterized by thousands of startup companies.</b><hr>

	Many of these fail in the period of retrenchment and consolidation that follows. As with other technological revolutions, eventually it is the large, already established firms who have the resources to exploit the new technology.<hr>

	The growth of the Internet, <b>when compared to other electronic technologies such as radio and television, has been much more rapid</b>: the Internet and Web achieved a 53 percent share of U.S. households in only 10 years. In comparison, it took 38 years for radio and 17 for television to achieve a 30 percent share.<hr>

	<b>Q10. What are the major limitations on the growth of e-commerce?</b><hr>
	<b>Which is potentially the toughest to overcome?</b><hr>

	<b>Skills</b>: one limitation is the need for many people to learn complicated operating systems, at least in comparison to other technologies such as the television or the telephone. People must also learn a set of sophisticated skills to make effective use of the Internet and e-commerce capabilities.<hr>

	<b>Shopping experience</b>: another limitation is the unlikelihood that the digital shopping experience will ever replace the social and cultural experience that many seek from the traditional shopping environment.<hr>

	<b>Income inequality</b>: Persistent global income inequality will exclude most of the world’s population, who do not and probably will not in the foreseeable future, have access to telephones or PCS.<hr>

	<b>Culture</b>: Social and cultural limitations are likely to be tougher to overcome than technological limitations.<hr>

	<b>Q11. Define disintermediation and explain the benefits to Internet users of such a phenomenon. How does disintermediation impact faction-free commerce?</b><hr>


	Disintermediation means <b>the removal of the market middlemen – the distributors, wholesalers, and other intermediaries</b> – between producers and customers.<hr>

	The predicted benefits to Internet users include <b>the decline of prices of products and services</b> as manufacturers and content originators develop a direct relationship with their customers, and the <b>elimination of payments to these middlemen.</b><hr>

	Disintermediation of markets would create intense competition.<hr>
	
	This, along with lowered transaction costs, would eliminate product brands, eventually resulting in the <b>elimination of unfair competitive advantages</b> and extraordinary returns on capital: the vision of friction-free commerce.<hr>


	<b>Q12. What are some of the major advantages and disadvantages of being a first mover?</b><hr>

	The major advantages of being a first mover are the ability to build <b>a brand name early</b> and establish <b>a large customer base before followers</b> enter the market, and the ability to build switching costs into the technology or services offered so that customers will find it discomfiting to change to a late entering competitor.<hr>

	The major disadvantage is that historically, many first movers have not succeeded and are instead replaced by the fast follower, larger firms with the financial, marketing, legal, and production assets necessary to develop mature markets.<hr>

	Generally, only <b>a handful of first mover firms become successful</b> long-term business as the start-up costs and time it takes to build a profitable business are often underestimated.<hr>


	<b>Q13. Discuss the ways in which the early years of e-commerce can be considered both a success and a failure.</b><hr>

	The early years of e-commerce can be considered a success because of the technological success that occurred as Web-enabled transactions <b>grew from thousands to billions.</b><hr>

	The digital infrastructure proved to be a solid foundation on which to build a viable marketing channel.<hr>

	From a business perspective, <b>the early years of e-commerce were a mixed success with just a tiny percentage of dot-com companies surviving.</b><hr>

	However, the survivors have benefited from the continued growth in B2C revenues.<hr>

	The early years of e-commerce can also be a considered a success in that the transfer of information has been a huge accomplishment as consumers learned to use the Web to procure information about products they wanted to purchase (Internet-influenced commerce).<hr>


	<b>Q14. What factors will help define the future of e-commerce over the next five years?</b><hr>


	The factors that will help define the future of e-commerce over the next five years include:<hr>

	<b><u>The technology of e-commerce</b> – the Internet, the Web, and the number of wireless appliances – will continue to proliferate through all commercial activity; overall revenues will continue rise rapidly; and the numbers of both visitors and products and services sold will continue to grow.</u><hr>

	<b><u>E-commerce margins and profits will rise to the level of traditional retailers.</u></b><hr>

	The top e-commerce sites will increasingly <b><u>obtain very well known brands from strong, older firms.</b></u><hr>

	<u>The number of successful purely online companies <b>will further decline.</b></u><hr>

	The most successful e-commerce firms will <u>use <b>both traditional marketing channels</b> such as physical stores, printed catalogs, and <b>e-commerce Web sites.</b></u><hr>

	<b>Q15. Why is a multidisciplinary approach necessary if one hopes to understand e-commerce? </b><hr>


	A multidisciplinary approach is necessary in order to understand e-commerce because <b><u>no single academic discipline covers all facets</b> of the e-commerce phenomenon.</u><hr>

	E-commerce is primarily a technologically driven occurrence, including information technologies developed over the past 50 years, with the Internet and the Web at the core.<hr>

	However, beyond the infrastructure are the <u>business purposes that drive the phenomenon</u>: the changing business models and strategies that will transform old companies and spawn new ones.<hr>
	
	To understand e-commerce, one must understand some basic <b>business concepts such as: Industry structures, business models, firm and industry value chains, and consumer behavior.</b><hr>

	They must also comprehend the <b><u>nature of electronic markets and information goods.</b></u><hr>

	Finally, the <i><b>impact on society</b> must be considered</i>: global e-commerce can have consequences for individuals concerning their intellectual property and privacy rights. Public policy issues such as equal access, equity, content control, and taxation will need to be addressed.<hr>
